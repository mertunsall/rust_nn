# rust_nn

Neural network stuff in Rust. To do list for the project:

- Find a way to download datasets such as MNIST
- Separate the optimizer in a Optimizer struct (later there will be Adam, GD, SGD, etc etc.)
- Update the training loop using the optimizer
- Implement CrossEntropyLoss for classification tasks
